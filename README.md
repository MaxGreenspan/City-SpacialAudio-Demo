# City-SpacialAudio-Demo

You can walk around the city and listen to ambient noises of this eclectic city! There are pictures of that city and a video tour below.

## Setup

* [Add the Unity SDK in Unity](https://docs.echo3d.com/unity/installation).

## Setup
* Download the 3D model(s) from the Models folder in the project.
* Go to echo3D console and click ["Add to Cloud"](https://docs.echo3d.co/quickstart/add-a-3d-model) and upload the models.

* If you have your secret key enabled, [add the security key](https://docs.echo3d.co/web-console/deliver-pages/security-page) for each project to the Global.cs script as well.
* (Recommended) Preview and edit the echo3D asset in real time.
To move, resize or edit the parent object for assets in Scene view, check the boxes for [“Editor Preview”](https://docs.echo3d.com/unity/hologram-script-settings#experimental-editor-preview) and [“Ignore Model Transforms”](https://docs.echo3d.com/unity/hologram-script-settings#ignore-model-transforms) on the echo3D script in Inspector. 
To enable this, click Echo3D > Load Editor Holograms in your Unity toolbar. 

## Run
Press Play in Unity and move your mouse to look around. You can walk in the direction you face using "WASD" Controls.
